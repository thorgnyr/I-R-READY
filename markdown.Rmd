###Text

###Bullets and numbering

###Code
Code can be displayed and executed in R markdown. On one hand it can be written inline, and on the other hand it can be written into code chunks. In code chunks there's a variety of display options available that we'll also include in the examples below. **Take note**, that since code chunks can't be displayed within code chunks, we'll need to implement them here within commenting symbols (##)

```{r, results = 'hold'}
##```{r}
##x <- 1 + 1
##```
##Above is a typical code chunk without any particular options.
