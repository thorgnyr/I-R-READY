###Making a vector.
Here are a few examples of a vector being defined. We're skipping assigning them to a variable to provide an immediate printout.

```{r, results='hold'}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ##Creates the elements 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
seq(1:5) ##Creates a sequence from 1 to (and including) 5.
seq(1, 5, length = 10) ##Creates a sequence of 10 steps from 1 to (and including) 5.
rep(1, 10) ##Creates a sequence of ten ones.
rep(c(1, 2, 3), 3) ##Creates a sequence that's composed of 1, 2, 3, three times over.
rep(c(1, 2, 3), each = 4) ##Creates a sequence that has four ones, four twos and four threes.
```
